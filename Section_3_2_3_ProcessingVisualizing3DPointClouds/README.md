# Section 3.2.3 â€“ Processing and Visualizing 3D Point Clouds

This module introduces the fundamentals of working with 3D point cloud data using Python. Part of the book  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it equips readers with practical tools to load, manipulate, and visualize unstructured 3D anatomical surfaces captured by scanners or reconstructed from image data.

Using libraries such as Open3D and NumPy, readers will build fluency in preparing point clouds for tasks like registration, surface reconstruction, and morphometric analysis.

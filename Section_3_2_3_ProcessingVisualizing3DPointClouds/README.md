# Processing and Visualizing 3D Point Clouds

This project demonstrates how to **process and visualize 3D point clouds** using Python. It provides practical examples of reading point cloud data, applying transformations, filtering, downsampling, estimating normals, and rendering results with interactive visualization tools. The goal is to give learners hands‑on experience with common workflows in 3D data processing.

## Overview

Point clouds are collections of 3D points that represent the shape of objects or environments. They are often captured by LiDAR scanners, depth cameras, or generated from 3D models. Working with point clouds involves not only visualizing them but also cleaning, transforming, and preparing them for further tasks such as surface reconstruction, registration, or machine learning.

This project shows how to:

- Load point clouds from files in formats such as `.ply` or `.pcd`
- Apply geometric transformations like translation, rotation, and scaling
- Downsample point clouds to reduce size while preserving structure
- Remove noise and outliers
- Estimate normals for surface orientation
- Visualize results interactively with different libraries

## Features

- **Point Cloud I/O**  
  Read and write point clouds in common formats for interoperability.

- **Transformations**  
  Apply translation, rotation, and scaling to reposition or resize point clouds.

- **Downsampling and Filtering**  
  Use voxel grid downsampling and statistical outlier removal to clean data.

- **Normal Estimation**  
  Compute normals to prepare point clouds for surface reconstruction or shading.

- **Visualization**  
  Render point clouds interactively with libraries such as Open3D and PyVista.

## Libraries Used

- [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/) – for point cloud processing and visualization  
- [PyVista](https://docs.pyvista.org/) – for interactive 3D plotting  
- [Trimesh](https://trimsh.org/) – for geometry handling  
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) – for numerical operations  

## Example Workflows

- Load a `.ply` point cloud of a scanned object and visualize it in 3D.  
- Apply a rotation to align the point cloud with a coordinate axis.  
- Downsample a dense LiDAR scan to make visualization faster.  
- Remove noisy points from a dataset using statistical filtering.  
- Estimate normals for a point cloud and visualize them as arrows.  

## Getting Started

To run the examples, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install open3d pyvista trimesh numpy

# Python Learning Projects

This repository contains two introductory Python projects that mark the early steps of learning Python. Each project focuses on a different aspect of programming, from writing your very first script to understanding how to structure larger projects.

## 1_1_5_FirstPythonScript

This project is all about writing and running your very first Python script. It introduces the basics of creating a `.py` file, adding simple commands, and executing them to see results. The purpose is to help beginners get comfortable with the process of coding in Python, while also highlighting the importance of readability and comments. Itâ€™s a gentle starting point that builds confidence in writing code and seeing it come to life.

## 1_1_6_PythonProjectOrganizationTypes

This project explores how Python projects can be organized as they grow in size and complexity. It introduces different approaches, from keeping everything in a single file to using multiple files, packages, and more structured application layouts. The goal is to show why organization matters, how it makes code easier to maintain, and how it prepares learners for working on larger, real-world projects. By experimenting with these structures, beginners gain an early understanding of best practices in project organization.

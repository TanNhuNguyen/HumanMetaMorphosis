# Section 1.1 ‚Äì Python Environment Setup

This module provides a foundational starting point for readers of the book  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025).

It walks you through setting up a Python development environment suitable for biomedical image analysis, 3D shape processing, and AI-driven modelling tasks. The tools and packages installed here are essential for executing all subsequent code examples across the book‚Äôs chapters.

## 1. Installation of Python on Microsoft Windows

- **Step 1:** Download the Python installer for Windows  
  Visit the official Python website:  
  [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)  

  In this book, we support only Python versions **from 3.7 to 3.12**.  
  Choose the appropriate version for your system (most users should select the **64-bit Windows installer**).

- **Step 2:** Run the downloaded installer  
  Double-click the `.exe` file to launch the Python Setup Wizard.  
  On the first screen, make sure to **check the box**:
  - ‚úÖ *Add Python 3.x to PATH*  
  Then click **Customize installation** (recommended) or **Install Now** for default settings.

- **Step 3 (Optional - Customize Installation):**  
  If you selected **Customize installation**, it's recommended to:
  - Keep all optional features checked (e.g., `pip`, `IDLE`, `Documentation`, `Python test suite`)
  - On the **Advanced Options** screen, enable:
    - ‚úÖ *Install for all users*
    - ‚úÖ *Add Python to environment variables*
    - ‚úÖ *Precompile standard library*

  Click **Install** to proceed.

- **Step 4:** Verify the installation  
  After installation completes, open the **Command Prompt** (`Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter), then type:

  ```bash
  python --version

## 2. Installation of Visual Studio Code on Microsoft Windows

- **Step 1:** Download the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installer for Windows from the official website:  
  [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- **Step 2:** Run the downloaded installer. During the setup process, it is recommended to:
  - Accept the license agreement  
  - Choose the default installation location  
  - **Enable the following options when prompted:**
    - *Add "Open with Code" action to Windows Explorer file context menu*
    - *Add to PATH (available after restart)*  
  These options make it easier to open folders/files in VS Code and access the `code` command from the Terminal.

- **Step 3:** Complete the installation by clicking **Install**, then **Finish**.

- **Step 4:** After installation, open **Visual Studio Code** from the Start Menu or Desktop shortcut. You can verify it's working by launching it and checking for the welcome screen.

- **Step 5 (Optional but Recommended):** Install the **Python extension**:
  - Go to the **Extensions** tab (left sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
  - Search for **Python** and install the extension developed by **Microsoft**  
  This extension provides syntax highlighting, linting, IntelliSense, and debugging support for Python.

## 3. Installation of Windows Terminal on Microsoft Windows

The Windows Terminal provides a modern, fast, and flexible terminal interface for Windows users. It is recommended for use with Python, Git, and other command-line tools in this book.

- **Step 1:** Open the Microsoft Store  
  Click on the **Start Menu**, search for **Microsoft Store**, and open it.

- **Step 2:** Search for "Windows Terminal"  
  In the Microsoft Store search bar, type:  
  `Windows Terminal`  
  Select the official app published by **Microsoft Corporation**.

- **Step 3:** Click **Get** or **Install**  
  Wait for the download and installation to complete.

- **Step 4:** Launch Windows Terminal  
  After installation, click **Open**, or find it later via the Start Menu by typing `Windows Terminal`.

- **Step 5 (Optional but Recommended):**  
  Set **Windows Terminal** as your default terminal:
  - Open **Windows Terminal**
  - Click the **dropdown arrow** (top bar) ‚Üí **Settings**
  - Under **Startup**, set:
    - *Default terminal application*: `Windows Terminal`
    - *Default profile*: choose your preferred shell (e.g., **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**)

  Click **Save** to apply changes.

Windows Terminal is now ready for use with Python, Git, and other development tools throughout this book.

## 4. How to Create a `.py` File and Run It Using Visual Studio Code and Windows Terminal

This section guides you through creating a Python file inside a folder, editing it using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, and running it with **Windows Terminal**.

### Step 1: Create a Folder for Your Project
- Navigate to the location where you want to create the project.
- Right-click and choose **New > Folder**, then name it (e.g., `MyPythonApp`).
- Open the folder in VS Code:
  - Right-click the folder and select **‚ÄúOpen with Code‚Äù**, or
  - Open VS Code and choose **File > Open Folder...**

### Step 2: Create a `.py` File
- In VS Code, click the **Explorer** icon (top-left).
- Click the **"New File"** icon or right-click inside the folder and select **"New File"**.
- Name the file something like: `main.py`.

### Step 3: Write Some Python Code
Inside `main.py`, write a simple script like:

```python
print("Hello from Visual Studio Code!")
```

### Step 4: Open Windows Terminal in the Project Folder

To run your Python script, you'll need to use Windows Terminal from the project directory.

#### Option 1: Open Terminal in VS Code
- Press `` Ctrl + ` `` (the backtick key) in Visual Studio Code to open the integrated terminal.
- It should automatically open in the project folder. If not, navigate to your folder using:

```bash
cd path\to\your\project
```
#### Option 2: Open Terminal from File Explorer

If you're not using Visual Studio Code, or prefer using the standalone Windows Terminal:

1. Open **File Explorer** and navigate to your project folder (e.g., `MyPythonApp`).
2. Right-click inside the folder (but not on a file).
3. Select **"Open in Terminal"** from the context menu.

This will launch Windows Terminal directly in the folder where your Python file is located.

You can now list the files in the directory to confirm your `.py` file exists:

```bash
dir
```

### Step 5: Run the Python Script

With your terminal open in the project folder and `main.py` ready, it‚Äôs time to run your first Python script!

#### Run the Script
Type the following command and press **Enter**:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 6. Python Project Organization Types

Organizing your Python code properly is essential for readability, scalability, and maintainability‚Äîespecially as your projects grow in complexity. In this section, we introduce the common ways Python projects are structured, including flat scripts, modular packages, and research-oriented layouts used in AI and biomedical applications.

üóÇÔ∏è **Note:** Full details and best practices for organizing Python projects are discussed extensively in **Section 1.1.6 of this book**. Please refer to that section for diagrams, folder structures, and annotated examples tailored to your development needs.

# Mesh Unifying and Refinement

This project demonstrates how to **unify multiple 3D meshes** into a single model and apply **refinement techniques** to improve mesh quality. It provides practical workflows for merging, cleaning, and enhancing meshes, making them more suitable for visualization, simulation, or 3D printing.

## Overview

Meshes generated from scans or reconstructions often come in fragments, with uneven resolution, holes, or redundant geometry. To make them usable, they need to be unified into a single consistent mesh and refined to improve smoothness, connectivity, and overall quality.  

This project shows how to:

- Load multiple mesh fragments from files  
- Merge them into a single unified mesh  
- Remove duplicate vertices and fix connectivity issues  
- Apply smoothing and subdivision for refinement  
- Visualize and compare original vs. refined meshes  

## Features

- **Mesh Unification**  
  Combine multiple mesh parts into a single watertight model.  
  Remove duplicate vertices and overlapping geometry.  

- **Mesh Refinement**  
  Apply smoothing filters to reduce noise.  
  Use subdivision techniques to increase resolution and improve surface quality.  
  Fill small holes and repair mesh defects.  

- **Visualization**  
  Render original and refined meshes interactively.  
  Compare side by side to evaluate improvements.  

## Libraries Used

- [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/) – for mesh processing, merging, and refinement  
- [Trimesh](https://trimsh.org/) – for geometry handling and mesh repair  
- [PyVista](https://docs.pyvista.org/) – for interactive 3D visualization  
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) – for numerical operations  

## Example Workflows

- Load multiple mesh fragments of a scanned object and unify them into a single model.  
- Apply Laplacian smoothing to reduce surface noise.  
- Use subdivision to refine a coarse mesh and improve detail.  
- Repair small holes and gaps to create a watertight mesh.  
- Visualize the original fragmented meshes and the final unified refined mesh.  

## Getting Started

To run the examples, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install open3d trimesh pyvista numpy

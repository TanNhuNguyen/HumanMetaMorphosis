# Section 3.7.2 â€“ Mesh Unifying and Refinement

This module focuses on integrating and improving 3D surface meshes to prepare them for downstream analysis or visualization. Part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it helps readers repair, simplify, and enhance anatomical meshes resulting from previous reconstruction workflows.

Mesh unification and refinement ensure that 3D anatomical models are watertight, topologically valid, and optimized for use in modelling, segmentation, or simulation tasks.

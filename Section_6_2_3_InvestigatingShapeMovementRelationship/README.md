# Section 6.2.3 – Investigating Shape–Movement Relationship

This module explores the dynamic interplay between anatomical shape and movement patterns using computational modeling and statistical analysis. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it introduces methods to correlate morphological features with biomechanical function.

Understanding how anatomical shape influences or reflects movement is critical for applications in rehabilitation, sports science, orthopedics, and personalized medicine.

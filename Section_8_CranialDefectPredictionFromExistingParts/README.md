# Section 8 â€“ Cranial Defect Prediction

This module presents computational approaches for predicting and reconstructing cranial defects using statistical and deep learning techniques. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it explores how incomplete or damaged skull geometries can be completed to generate anatomically plausible reconstructions.

These methods are critical for cranioplasty planning, forensic reconstruction, and trauma recovery, where accurate implant design and cranial restoration are required.

# Cranial Defect Prediction

This project demonstrates how to predict and analyze **cranial defects** using 3D skull models and computational methods. It focuses on detecting missing or damaged regions of the skull, estimating their boundaries, and preparing data for potential reconstruction. The project is designed as a resource for medical imaging, surgical planning, forensics, and computational anatomy.

## Overview

Cranial defects can result from trauma, surgery, or congenital conditions. Identifying and predicting the extent of these defects is crucial for planning reconstructive surgery and for biomechanical or anthropological studies.  

This project shows how to:

- Load and preprocess 3D skull meshes or point clouds  
- Identify missing or defective regions in the skull geometry  
- Estimate the boundaries of cranial defects  
- Predict the shape of missing regions using symmetry, interpolation, or statistical models  
- Visualize original skulls, defect regions, and predicted reconstructions  

## Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**  
  Import skull meshes from `.ply`, `.stl`, or `.obj` formats.  
  Normalize, align, and clean meshes for consistent analysis.  

- **Defect Detection**  
  Identify holes, gaps, or irregularities in skull meshes.  
  Extract defect boundaries for further processing.  

- **Defect Prediction**  
  Apply geometric or statistical methods to estimate missing skull regions.  
  Use symmetry‑based approaches (mirroring intact regions) or interpolation to fill defects.  

- **Visualization**  
  Render skulls with highlighted defect regions.  
  Compare original, defective, and predicted skull models side by side.  

- **Export**  
  Save predicted reconstructions for use in surgical planning, 3D printing, or further analysis.  

## Libraries Used

- [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/) – for mesh and point cloud processing  
- [Trimesh](https://trimsh.org/) – for geometry handling and mesh repair  
- [PyVista](https://docs.pyvista.org/) – for interactive 3D visualization  
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) – for numerical operations  
- [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) – for interpolation and statistical methods  
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) – for predictive modeling (if statistical approaches are used)  

## Example Workflows

- Load a skull mesh with a cranial defect and detect the missing region.  
- Extract the defect boundary and visualize it in 3D.  
- Apply symmetry‑based prediction to reconstruct the missing part of the skull.  
- Use interpolation or statistical shape modeling to estimate defect closure.  
- Save the reconstructed skull mesh for surgical or research applications.

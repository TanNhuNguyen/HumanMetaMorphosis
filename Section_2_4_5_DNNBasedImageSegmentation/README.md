# Section 2.4.5 – Deep Neural Network–Based Image Segmentation

This module presents the application of deep learning techniques for medical image segmentation using 2D anatomical scan data. It is part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025).

By introducing convolutional neural network architectures such as U-Net, this section enables readers to train and test automated segmentation models. These models are especially valuable when working with noisy or low-contrast anatomical data where classical image processing struggles.

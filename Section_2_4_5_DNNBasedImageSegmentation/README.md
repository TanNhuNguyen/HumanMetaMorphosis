# DNN-Based Image Segmentation

This project demonstrates how to perform **medical image segmentation** using **deep neural networks (DNNs)** in Python. It focuses on applying pre-trained models to medical images such as CT or MRI scans, generating segmentation masks, and visualizing the results alongside the original images.

## Overview

Deep learning has become one of the most powerful approaches for medical image analysis. Unlike classical image processing methods, DNNs can learn complex patterns directly from data, making them highly effective for tasks like tumor detection, organ segmentation, and anomaly localization. This project shows how to:

- Load medical images (e.g., CT or MRI slices)
- Apply a trained deep learning model for segmentation
- Generate binary or multi-class masks
- Overlay segmentation results on the original images
- Save and visualize the outputs for further analysis

## Features

- **Model-Based Segmentation**  
  Use a pre-trained deep neural network to automatically segment regions of interest from medical images.

- **Overlay Visualization**  
  Display segmentation masks in color and overlay them on grayscale medical images for intuitive interpretation.

- **Batch Processing**  
  Apply segmentation to multiple slices or images in sequence.

- **Result Saving**  
  Save predicted masks and overlay images to disk for later inspection.

## Libraries Used

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) – for deep learning model loading and inference  
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) – for image loading, processing, and visualization  
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) – for numerical operations  
- [pydicom](https://pydicom.github.io/) – for reading DICOM medical images (if working with CT/MRI scans)  

## Example Workflows

- Load a brain MRI slice and run it through a pre-trained segmentation model to detect tumor regions.  
- Overlay the predicted mask in red on the grayscale MRI image for easy visualization.  
- Process a series of CT slices, saving both the raw masks and overlay images.  
- Compare model predictions with ground truth masks (if available) for evaluation.

## Getting Started

To run the examples, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy pydicom

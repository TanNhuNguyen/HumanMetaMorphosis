# Section 4.4.2 â€“ Skull Shape Personalization

This module presents techniques for personalizing 3D skull models based on individual anatomical data or statistical priors. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it explores how subject-specific skull geometries can be generated or adapted using sparse measurements, landmarks, or projection-based cues.

Skull shape personalization is essential for applications in surgical planning, forensic reconstruction, and patient-specific implant design.

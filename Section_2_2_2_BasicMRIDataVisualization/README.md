# Section 2.2.2 â€“ Basic MRI Data Visualization

This module introduces the fundamentals of reading and visualizing MRI scan data using Python. It is part of the book  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025).

The focus is on helping readers interact with DICOM-formatted MRI data, extract basic image volume metadata, and visualize anatomical structures from orthogonal perspectives.

## Short Contents

# Section 5.3.3 â€“ Head Shape Prediction from Skull Geometry

This module explores computational methods for predicting external head morphology based on internal skull geometry. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it introduces statistical and learning-based approaches to estimate soft-tissue contours from bony structures.

This inverse problem is critical in forensic reconstruction, surgical planning, and anthropometric modeling where only skeletal data is available.

# Section 7.5 â€“ Mesh Generation and Enhancement Software

This module surveys key tools and libraries used for generating and refining 3D surface and volumetric meshes. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it introduces open-source and commercial platforms that support anatomical mesh creation, repair, and optimization.

Mesh generation and enhancement are essential for preparing anatomical models for simulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

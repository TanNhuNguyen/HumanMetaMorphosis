# Section 3.3.3 â€“ 3D Surface Mesh Reconstruction from Point Clouds

This module guides readers through the process of reconstructing 3D surface meshes from point cloud data using Python. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it lays the foundation for generating watertight or adaptive anatomical surfaces suitable for analysis, visualization, and simulation.

Utilizing tools such as Open3D and Trimesh, this section illustrates techniques like Poisson surface reconstruction and alpha shapes for converting noisy point sets into structured surface geometries.

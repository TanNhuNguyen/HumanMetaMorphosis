# Section 6.3.3 â€“ Shape Deformation Prediction Under External Forces

This module introduces computational techniques for predicting how anatomical structures deform in response to external mechanical forces. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it bridges shape modeling with biomechanics to simulate and analyze deformation behavior.

These methods are essential for applications in surgical simulation, prosthetic design, injury analysis, and functional morphology.

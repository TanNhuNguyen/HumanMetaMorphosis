# Section 2.3.3 â€“ Simple DICOM Image Enhancement

This module introduces basic techniques for enhancing medical images in DICOM format using Python. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it gives readers practical tools to improve visual quality and contrast of scan data as a preprocessing step for segmentation and shape analysis.

The focus is on using pixel-level enhancements and filtering techniques to prepare raw DICOM data for interpretation and downstream computational workflows.

## Short Contents

- Reading DICOM files and normalizing pixel values  
- Applying basic enhancement methods (e.g., histogram equalization, contrast stretching)  
- Implementing median and Gaussian filtering for noise suppression  
- Visualizing before-and-after comparison of enhanced images  
- Saving results for later modules in segmentation or shape characterization

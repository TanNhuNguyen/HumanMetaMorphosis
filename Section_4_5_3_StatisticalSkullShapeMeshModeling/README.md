# Section 4.5.3 â€“ Statistical Skull Shape Modeling

This module introduces statistical shape modeling (SSM) techniques for analyzing and synthesizing 3D skull geometries. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it demonstrates how to construct low-dimensional models that capture population-level variability in cranial morphology.

These models enable applications such as shape interpolation, classification, reconstruction from sparse data, and personalized cranial implant design.

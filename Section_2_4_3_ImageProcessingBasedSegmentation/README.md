# Section 2.4.3 – Image Processing–Based Segmentation

This module introduces classical image processing techniques for medical image segmentation using 2D anatomical scans. It is part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025).

It demonstrates how thresholding, morphological operations, and region-based filters can be used to isolate anatomical structures in grayscale images—a foundational step for building shape models and performing quantitative analyses.

# Section 7.2 â€“ Medical Image Processing Tools

This module provides an overview of widely used software tools and libraries for processing, analyzing, and visualizing medical images. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it introduces both open-source and commercial platforms that support workflows in segmentation, registration, enhancement, and 3D reconstruction.

Understanding the capabilities and limitations of these tools is essential for selecting the right platform for research, clinical, or educational applications.

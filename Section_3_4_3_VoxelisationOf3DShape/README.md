# Section 3.4.3 – Voxelisation of 3D Shapes

This module introduces the concept and implementation of voxelisation—the process of converting continuous surface models into structured 3D grid representations. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), this section provides readers with foundational tools to work with binary and signed voxel volumes suitable for morphometric measurements, deep learning, and simulation workflows.

Voxelisation bridges geometric and volumetric representations, enabling shape abstraction, comparison, and volumetric data integration.

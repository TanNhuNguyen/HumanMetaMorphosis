# Section 1.6.2 - 3-D Point Cloud Visualization

This module introduces the fundamentals of representing 3D anatomical structures using Python and NumPy arrays. As part of the book  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), this section lays the groundwork for all geometry-based processing tasks in later chapters.

By exploring voxel grids, coordinate arrays, and simple shape generation, readers will learn how to encode, manipulate, and visualize basic 3D objects in codeâ€”crucial for any computational shape modelling pipeline.

## Short Contents

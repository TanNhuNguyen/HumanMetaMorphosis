# Section 4.3.3 â€“ Projection-Based Skull Shape Generation

This module introduces a projection-based approach for generating 3D skull shapes from partial or 2D anatomical data. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), this section explores how axial or sagittal projections can be used to reconstruct plausible cranial geometries.

The method is particularly useful in scenarios where full 3D scans are unavailable, enabling shape estimation from limited imaging data.

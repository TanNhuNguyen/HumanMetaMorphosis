# Section 7.3 – Medical Image Segmentation Software

This module surveys key software platforms and libraries used for medical image segmentation. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it highlights both classical and deep learning–based tools that support segmentation workflows across various imaging modalities.

Understanding the capabilities of these tools enables researchers and clinicians to select appropriate solutions for anatomical delineation, tumor detection, and organ modeling.

# Section 4.6.1 â€“ Skull Shape Analyses

This module presents methods for analyzing 3D skull shapes using statistical and geometric techniques. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it equips readers with tools to quantify, compare, and interpret cranial morphology across individuals or populations.

These analyses are essential for understanding anatomical variation, detecting pathological deviations, and supporting applications in anthropology, surgery, and forensic science.

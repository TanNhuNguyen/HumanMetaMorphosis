# Section 4.6.2 â€“ Head Shape Analyses

This module presents computational methods for analyzing 3D head shapes using statistical and geometric techniques. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it equips readers with tools to quantify and interpret cranial and facial morphology across individuals or populations.

These analyses support applications in craniofacial research, biometric identification, surgical planning, and anthropometric studies.

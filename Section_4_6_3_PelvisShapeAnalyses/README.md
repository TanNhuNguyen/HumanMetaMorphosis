# Section 4.6.3 â€“ Pelvis Shape Analyses

This module presents computational and statistical methods for analyzing 3D pelvis shapes. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it equips readers with tools to quantify pelvic morphology, explore anatomical variation, and perform comparative studies across populations or clinical groups.

These analyses are foundational for applications in orthopedics, forensic anthropology, obstetrics, and biomechanical modeling.

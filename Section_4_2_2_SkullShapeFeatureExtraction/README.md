# Section 4.2.2 â€“ Skull Shape Feature Extraction

This module introduces computational methods for extracting meaningful features from 3D skull surface models. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it provides foundational tools for analyzing morphological landmarks and curvature patterns across cranial anatomy.

The extracted features serve as inputs for downstream statistical shape modelling, shape correspondence, classification tasks, and craniofacial morphology studies.

# Section 3.6.2 â€“ Point Cloud Noise Reduction

This module focuses on reducing noise in 3D point cloud datasets to improve accuracy and clarity for downstream reconstruction or analysis. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), this section introduces spatial and statistical filtering techniques to clean raw point cloud data commonly acquired from laser scans or photogrammetry.

Noise reduction is a critical preprocessing step for improving point cloud quality, ensuring better results in tasks such as surface meshing, registration, or morphological analysis.

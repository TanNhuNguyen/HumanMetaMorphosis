# Section 2.2.6 â€“ Basic Laser Optical Data Visualization

This module introduces the visualization of 3D anatomical surface data acquired through laser optical scanning systems. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), this section helps readers become familiar with processing point clouds and mesh files captured via non-invasive optical techniques.

The aim is to load, inspect, and interact with these 3D datasets using Python tools such as `open3d` and `trimesh`, and to prepare them for further alignment or analysis.

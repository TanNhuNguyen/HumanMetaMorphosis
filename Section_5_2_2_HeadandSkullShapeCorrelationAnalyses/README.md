# Section 5.2.2 â€“ Head and Skull Shape Correlation

This module explores the geometric and statistical relationships between 3D head and skull shapes. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it investigates how external head morphology reflects underlying cranial structure, enabling predictive modeling and anatomical inference.

Understanding these correlations is essential for applications in craniofacial reconstruction, biometric analysis, and personalized medicine.

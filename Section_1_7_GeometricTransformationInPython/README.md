# Section 1.7 – Geometric Transformations in Python

This module explores the implementation of geometric transformations—translation, scaling, rotation, reflection, and affine operations—using NumPy and Python matrices. Building on the 3D representation concepts introduced in Section 1.6, this section equips readers with the skills to manipulate anatomical structures computationally. It forms a crucial backbone for shape normalization, registration, and statistical analysis tasks presented in later chapters of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025).

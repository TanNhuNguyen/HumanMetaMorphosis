# Section 7.4 â€“ Tools for Point Cloud Processing

This module surveys key software libraries and platforms used for processing 3D point cloud data. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it introduces open-source and commercial tools that support workflows such as filtering, registration, segmentation, and surface reconstruction.

These tools are essential for preparing anatomical point clouds for downstream modeling, visualization, and analysis.

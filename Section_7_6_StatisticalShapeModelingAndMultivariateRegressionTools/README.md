# Section 7.6 â€“ Statistical Shape Modeling and Tools

This module surveys key software libraries and frameworks used for statistical shape modeling (SSM) of anatomical structures. As part of  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), it introduces open-source and commercial tools that support workflows such as shape alignment, correspondence, model building, and shape synthesis.

These tools are foundational for building population-based models, performing shape analysis, and enabling predictive modeling in biomedical applications.

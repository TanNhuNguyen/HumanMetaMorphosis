# Section 3.5.2 â€“ Point Cloud and Mesh Resampling

This module explores techniques for resampling 3D anatomical data represented as point clouds and surface meshes. Part of the book  
"Human Anatomical Shape Metamorphosis: Statistical Shape Modelling, AI-Driven Prediction, and Applications"  
by Tan-Nhu Nguyen and Tien-Tuan Dao (ISTE Group, London, 2025), this section helps readers generate uniformly distributed 3D data suitable for reconstruction, statistical modeling, and machine learning.

Whether working with noisy scanner output or high-resolution anatomical surfaces, resampling is critical for improving geometric consistency and computational efficiency across downstream workflows.
